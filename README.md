# Parallelization-of-heuristic-algorithms-and-their-implementation-in-Python
This project presents the parallel implementation of the A* algorithm using Python. Experimental results are compared with the sequential version of algorithm A* to find an optimal or near optimal path between two points in a grid. Parallelization is adopted in order to run several independent program tasks simultaneously to minimize the execution time of the entire program. The execution time is the biggest drawback of the algorithm A*, because it examines each of the neighboring nodes, from a starting node to an arrival node. Therefore, the fact that different threads are running simultaneously to find the path of each neighbor from the starting node to the arrival node should significantly reduce the computation time. To evaluate the performance of the parallel version of the A* algorithm we used two parameters; the execution time and the speedup. The simulations are conducted with a different number of threads.
